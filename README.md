This game is about a guy named Crazy Steve who wants to destroy the "mothership" responsible for the chemtrailz.
You are playing as this character, or rather are navigating his plane, using the arrow keys.
There are a few objects, like "nitro", which will make you go faster, and thus collect more miles, or gas masks which will get rid of the 
chemtrailz that you might have inhaled. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible, which will get increasingly more difficult, since the
enemies speed will pick up at certain "mile thresholds". 
Everything is implemented and drawn by myself, without using any assets or pre-written scripts.
A challenge was the game menu with functioning buttons, which wasn't covered in the lectures, as well as the constant "spawning and destroying" of
the chemtrailz behind the enemy planes, since they should appear in a certain rythm, but should also leave that way, while still being responsible for the screen to get "foggy" if you flew (inhaled) through the chemtrailz.
